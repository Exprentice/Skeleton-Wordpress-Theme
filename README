This is simply my standard blank HTML5 Wordpress theme. I use it as a jumping-off point for my
projects. It is based heavily on the "Blank" theme by Chris Coyier (it can be found at digwp.com).
The original theme is HTML4, so I HTML5'd it up and am adding a couple of stuff such as:
- four widget areas in convenient places for me: Header, Nav (for WP3 menu), Sidebar, Footer
- WP3 menus (create your menus and add as widgets within WP)
- a bunch of stuff in the functions.php file
- my very specific, and probably wrong, HTML5 document structure. If you think it is wrong, (for
  example, I don't think that I'm using <aside> correctly), let me know. A good thing, though - I am
  not using a wrapper div. The .body class works just fine for that in most cases.

That document structure is as follows:
BODY [body class, not to be confused with .body]
-HEADER.body
-NAV.body
-SECTION.body [.index .page .single .archive]
--aside
--article [post class]
---header
---section
---footer
----section.comments
-----article[.alt]
------header
------[comment text]
--nav.pagination
---ul
---li (there are two li's, one for "prev posts" and one for "next posts")
-FOOTER.body

I use a modified Toucan CSS Reset combined with some ideas from the CSS LESS framework (media
queries for different screen sizes). I also place my CSS files in a <theme>/css folder and that
location is used in the header.php file of the theme. The normal style.css is used only for theme
information.

There are a couple template html files for easy development.

I guarantee that this whole theme will change over time.
